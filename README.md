A simple go application for connection to servers using ssh.

Things are hardcoded for now:

## Roadmap

- Add a conf package to allow configuring, using the cli, servers and keys. Those things are harcoded for now.
- Add installation instructions.
- Done.

**The point of this app is to help me simplify connection to servers that I frequently connect to. It's purpose should be simple.**
